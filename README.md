Pixel lets you create pixel art: drawings with jagged edges which looks like an image zoomed in to a great extent. This gives it a distinct unique feel.

To draw just click and drag your mouse or use the arrow keys to move the block head. You can also change the color of the block and increase/decrease the size of the paint brush.

Here is mario drawn out using Pixel

Happy Pixeling :-)
